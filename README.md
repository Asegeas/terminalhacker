Just a simple python program designed to make you look cool : )

I included a reference to one of my favorite anolog horror series.

Small warning: The code used in the JSON has not been tested please do not attempt to run any of it. While most of it is likely safe I did not intend for any user to try it and I do not want to feel responsible for any dammage the code may have.

Functionality:
First prompts user to say y/n this is a trick it is looking for a numerical input.
The time it takes may vary but the default numerical value is 64. This means the sequence will loop 64 times which i estimate is at least 5 minutes or so of green text.

Future direction:
If I get around to it I might add additional functionality to control the 'randomness'. I was thinking making it so it never repeats a script twice in a row, for now this is 'fixed' by using two different keys in the dictionary. Every other line is from a different set of options that is completely different from the other set.

Additional work:
I made a random vector generator in Rust. Initially I was trying to make a sudoku game but I gave up cause I really didnt have the time.

I made a 'conspiracy' generator using OPENAI in python. Keep in mind access to GTP-4 openAI key is required as conspiracies are too dangerous for free GTP. Please do not use this for any political purposes.

Feel free to clone and modify the JSON to include whatever script you like.
If you do create your own version I would love to see it! : 3
