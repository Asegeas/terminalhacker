Just a simple python program designed to make you look cool : )

I included a reference to one of my favorite anolog horror series.

Functionality:
First prompts user to say y/n this is a trick it is looking for a numerical input.
The time it takes may vary but the default numerical value is 64. This means the sequence will loop 64 times which i estimate is at least 5 minutes or so of green text.

Feel free to clone and modify the JSON to include whatever script you like.
If you do create your own version I would love to see it! : 3
